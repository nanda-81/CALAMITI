## üìå Overview  
CALAMITI (Cross-modality Advanced Learning Approach for Medical Image Translation and Integration) addresses major challenges in neuroimaging by harmonizing heterogeneous MRI data across different scanners and protocols.  

By leveraging fusion networks, autoencoders, and adversarial style transfer (CycleGAN), this framework enhances image quality and structural consistency, enabling reliable downstream clinical and AI analyses.

## üöÄ Project Highlights  
- **Robust 3D deep learning pipeline** to harmonize multi-site MRI scans (T1, T2) using advanced fusion and autoencoder networks.  
- Achieves **high-fidelity image harmonization** improving inter-scanner consistency with PSNR ‚Üë from 28.4 dB to 32.7 dB and SSIM ‚Üë from 0.74 to 0.89.  
- Incorporates **CycleGAN style transfer** for cross-domain harmonization and artifact minimization without paired training data.  
- Accelerated with **CUDA, mixed precision, and data parallelism** enabling 5√ó faster inference and scalable training on large 3D datasets.  
- Fully reproducible via an **interactive Google Colab notebook** with prebuilt workflows for preprocessing, training, and visualization.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Design and implement a **scalable deep learning pipeline** for cross-modality MRI harmonization.  
- Enhance **contrast consistency** and anatomical fidelity between T1 and T2 scans.  
- Provide **easy reproducibility** with a prepared Colab notebook and modular codebase.  
- Enable **robust performance benchmarking** using quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM).  
- Lay groundwork for clinical AI integration and multi-modal extensions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup  

Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
git clone https://github.com/nanda-81/CALAMITI.git
cd CALAMITI
pip install -r requirements.txt


Or open the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nanda-81/CALAMITI/blob/main/CALAMITI_NNK_clean.ipynb) directly for instant cloud execution.

## üé¨ Quick Start Guide  

1. Open the Colab notebook, mount your Google Drive containing MRI datasets in `/data/`.  
2. Run preprocessing cells to generate encoded slices.  
3. Train harmonization model:
   !python code/train_harmonization.py
4. 4. Run 3D decoding & reconstruction:  
   !python code/decode_3d.py
5. Visualize harmonized results inline or review saved outputs in `/results/`.

## üìä Results & Performance  

CALAMITI consistently delivers improved MRI harmonization quality:  

| Metric            | Baseline   | CALAMITI    |  
|-------------------|------------|-------------|  
| PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) ‚Üë | 28.4 dB     | 32.7 dB      |  
| SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) ‚Üë | 0.74       | 0.89        |  

  - Visual results:
